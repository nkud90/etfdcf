ETF DCF is a project which allows user to view a list of ETFs with their fair (intrinsic) value calculated using discounted cash flows (DCF) model.

Current blocking issue:
DCF model relies on future earnings estimate. How to derive the figure without heavy reliance on potentially biased analysts' estimates?

Potential solutions
1. At least half of the estimate can include past performance.
2. For another part a metric should be developed which derives the potential overall economic growth from a price-related and therefore timely and so-called coincident indicator, such as credit spreads.
